<h1>Review of "Pandas for Everyone: Python Data Analysis"</h1>
<h4>Author: Daniel Chen</h4>
<h5>Reviewer: Josh Butch</h5>

Pandas is a very popular Python library used to analyze data, and one that is becoming more relevant than ever in the workplace.  This post is a collection of Pandas analysis examples.  I hope to use this as a future reference for code snippets and demonstrate proficiency with the Pandas library.  The ability to organize and analyze data is relevant to every facet of data science and business intelligence/analysis.<br><br>
Pandas is open source and has a very strong support community online.  If you have questions about Pandas and have exhausted the documentation check Stack Overflow.  Pandas introduces two new data types: `DataFrame` and `Series`.  Think of the `DataFrame` as a representation of the entire spreadsheet and `Series` is a column of the `DataFrame`.  Daniel Chen also says, "A Pandas `DataFrame` can also be thought of as a dictionary or collection of `Series` objects" (pg 1).
