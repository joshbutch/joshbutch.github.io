## Overview of my remote Hadoop VC (virtual cluster) with Ambari and Vagrant

The first couple of courses in the data science program focus on getting a Hadoop VC running on your local machine to start learning MapReduce, Hbase, Spark, etc. Unfortunately, I don't own a computer with the proper hardware resources to handle more than one virtual machine without crashing. 

The answer my professor and I came up with is that I would login to the school's cobalt computer and do the projects remotely. It adds a layer of complexity as the course instructions are written for all to be done locally. It's been a fun, frustrating, interesting journey so far, and it was this project that really ignited my interest in data engineering.

### Project Overview

There are __many__ tutorials out there about setting up a virtual machine on a local computer, but I wanted to document my journey of doing this remotely on our school's cobalt computer. 

I use Cmder to ssh into the school computer. Cmder is a console emulator for Windows and it has worked seamlessly as the terminal between my laptop and the cobalt computer.
