<h2>Image Scraper for JANN machine learning training sets</h2>
<h4>Scope</h4>
My goal for this image scraper is to build an initial positive and negative training set for JANN.  There are lots of image datasets for deep learning applications, but I think it's valuable for every data professional to be able to effectively mine their own data.  This is the first Python program I'll be writing for myself.  I hope to provide the systematic and thorough account of my work to make it easy to reproduce.
