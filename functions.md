<h1>How to Write a Function in Python3</h1>
<h4>Best practices for writing your own functions</h4>

<h5>What is a function?</h5>
In Python, a function is a block of code that runs only when it's called.  This is referred to as a "function call."  Functions can be simple or complex, but regardless, you'll want to use functions as extensively as possible.  There's an unwritten rule among programmers that a function should be used anytime you'll type that same piece of code more than two times.  Write as many functions as possible, regardless of how trivial they may seem.

<h5>Components of a function</h5>
Best practices for writing functions should at the minimum include the steps below.  One of the most frustrating parts of programming is working with poorly commented code to include incomplete function design.  If you follow these steps you'll write solid functions that are clear and useful to others.  Here are the six steps I use(modified from multiple sources referenced below):

1.  Give examples of what your function should do.
    - Think about what your function should do
