<h3>Regis University Data Science Practicum I</h3>
<h5>Proposed Topic:  Real-time Object Detection for Retail Business Intelligence</h5>
<h5>Due Date:  Summer I 2019 (May-June)</h5>
<h5>Practicum Advisor:  Aiman Gannous</h5>

__Overview:__  A machine learning computer vision model to utilize retail video cameras to learn more about the shopping habits of customers.

__The Model:__ 

[Customer Counter Notebook](CustomerCounterNotebook.html)
  - The Jupyter Notebook outlining each section of code in my customer counter python file.

__The Code:__ 

[Still Image Object Detector](imageObjectDetector.py)
  - The python code for a still image object detector.
  
[Customer Counter](customer_counter.py)
  - The python code to count human objects crossing a line of demarcation.  Intended to count customers crossing a specific plane intended to replicate the entrance/exit of a retail store.

[Generate a random dataset](randomdataset.html) - 12.20.2018<br>
  - Working Python code (converted from Jupyter Notebook to HTML) to create a basic (pseudo)random dataset (.ipynb file is on main Github repository.)  This is a decent starting point to build more robust datasets for testing statistical models.

[Getting to Know Pandas](pandas.html) - 01.08.2019<br>
  - Using Daniel Chen's "Pandas for Everyone" to work through data analysis exercises.  I plan to use this as a code snippet repository, reference for the future, and demonstration of my proficiency with the Pandas library.

[Openstack Cloud Project](openstack.md) - Spring 2019<br>
  - Setting up a proof-of-concept Openstack cloud for Regis University - College of Computer and Information Sciences (CC&IS) department using three used servers.  The goal is to secure funding for additional new hardware and eventually have a private cloud with large compute resources for student and department research projects.
