__About Me__: I'm currently a graduate student in Denver, CO at Regis University. The program is a master's of science in data science. 

I have a family and we enjoy spending time in the garden with our backyard chickens. We also like getting out to the mountains and Boulder to do skiing and hiking.

__Intention of My Blog__: To track the progress of, and have dialogue about, my final practicum project due Aug. 2019.

### Meet JANN (Josh's Artificial Neural Network)

JANN will be my final practicum project for my M.S. in data science. My goal is to build a deep learning neural network that will analyze real-time video for object detection and subsequent action. I feel there are applications for this technology in every industry. In the end, I hope to advance my understanding in these technologies and show proficiency for future deep learning analysis.

There will be a few iterations of JANN as the positive image training set I plan on using to train the final version of JANN will need to be mined over the next few months, I'll get into that a little bit later. My first goal is to build a basic ann with OpenCV that will be trained to detect and count the loose change thrown into a frame.
