__About Me__: I'm currently a graduate student in Denver, CO at Regis University. The program is a master's of science in data science. My current focus is on data engineering, as the more I learn about it the more intrigued I become with the technology. I have about a year to go with an anticipated graduation date in May/June 2019.

I've always been interested in technology, ever since I was a young kid taking apart my electronic toys and not being able to put them back together (at least without a few "spare" parts.) I like understanding how things work at the deepest level I can comprehend. I enjoy reading but don't really do it for leisure - I read to learn.

I have a family and we enjoy spending time in the garden with our backyard chickens. We also like getting out to the mountains and Boulder to do hiking and skiing.

__Technology Interests__: Computer Programming - Python, R, and SQL<br><br>
                          Apache Hadoop Ecosystem - A big data framework that consists mainly of 4 core elements (click on each to learn more):  
  1. [HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsUserGuide.html)
  2. [Commons](https://commons.apache.org/)
  3. [YARN (Yet Another Resource Manager)](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html)
  4. [MapReduce](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/MapReduceTutorial.html)

__Intention of My Blog__: I'm learning a lot right now which often leads to more questions. I'm hoping to use this blog as place to share information and ideas to progress the data science and data engineering industry. <br><br>I'm also looking for a repository to store projects, show coding progression/proficiency, and collaborate with others on various projects related to data engineering and data science.

#### Blog #1: [Setting up my first remote virtual cluster](joshbutch.github.io/_posts/cobalt_cluster.md)

***
__To Do List__: A quick reference of things to do that pop into my head:<br><br>
-[x] Update personal info on blog intro page<br>
-[x] Complete Strong Skills Assessment<br>
-[ ] Read Hadoop documentation<br>
-[ ] Document setup of remote virtual cluster<br>
-[ ] Create separate page for grad school course descriptions and grades<br>
-[ ] Complete virtual web server for live-streaming data pipeline project<br><br>
