__My School__: I'm currently a graduate student in Denver, CO at Regis University. The program is a master's of science in data science, and I would highly recommend this program to anyone considering a graduate degree in this field. The entire program - curriculum, professors, support staff - have all exceeded my expectations. 

__About Me__: I have a young family so we are always on the go. We enjoy spending time in our garden and the great local parks in our neighborhood. We also like getting out to the foothills and mountains to do all of the outdoor things.

__Intention of My Blog__: To track the progress of, and have dialogue about, my final practicum project due Aug. 2019.

### Meet JANN (Josh's Artificial Neural Network)

JANN will hopefully be my final practicum project for graduate degree. My goal is to build a deep learning neural network that will analyze real-time video for object detection and subsequent action. I feel there are applications for this technology in every industry. Computer vision is obviously a focus of the industry and also very interesting, so I feel this project will blend many of my data science aspirations. In the end, I hope to show enough proficiency and promise to warrant continued work in either academia or the private sector.

There will be a few iterations of JANN as the positive image training set I plan on using to train the final version of JANN will need to be mined over the next few months, I'll get into that a little bit later. My first goal is to build a basic ann with OpenCV that will be trained to detect and count the loose change thrown into a frame. The newest version of OpenCV comes with a dnn package: deep neural networks. From what I've read so far this will be my starting point as soon as the project is approved.
