<h3>Regis University Data Science Practicum I</h3>
<h5>Proposed Topic (not approved):  Object detection and classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</h5>
<h5>Due Date:  Summer I 2019 (May-July)</h5>
<h5>Practicum Advisor:  TBD</h5>

__Overview:__  Part one will develop and train a CNN to identify a particular set of brand logos from a live video feed.  Detection of an object by the CNN will display an appropriate advertisement on a display screen (a.k.a. billboard.)  A practical application for this technology is real-time target marketing in public places (i.e. bus stops, sporting events, concerts, busy shopping districts, etc.)  In part two of the practicum I will scale out my model to perform what I'm calling "passive-direct target marketing" (name is still under consideration.)<br>
